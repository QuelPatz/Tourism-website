						<h2>Shell beach</h2>
						<p>Praia da Conchas in Ubatuba, is a lovely beach, as the access is more difficult, the beach is very preserved and maintains its natural aspects, in addition to being deserted most of the year!
						Therefore, this beautiful beach is surrounded by nature and its main feature is the fact that it is full of shells and stones, which gives the name to the beach.
						Going to Praia das Conchas is already the main outing of the day, because getting there is not easy, you will have to do a trail with some difficulty and that requires effort.
						Once there, the translucent sea invites you to take a dip!</p>

						<h2>Domingas Dias beach</h2>
						<p>Ubatuba's Praia Domingas Dias is the ideal beach for those seeking a little more serenity. It is also among the greatest beaches in Ubatuba for families, who may take advantage of the tranquil setting and quiet waters.
						About 400 meters long, the tiny Praia Domingas Dias has soft sand and clear, tranquil waters.
						Large stones and an abundance of plants from the Atlantic Forest line its coastline.
						The beautiful surroundings are made even more inviting by the lush green of the trees.
						Domingas Dias benefits from being adjacent to Saco da Ribeira, where a number of schooners and speedboats depart for the beaches and islands of Ubatuba.</p>

						<h2>Lagoinha beach</h2>
						<p>Lagoinha is a beach in the southern part of Ubatuba that offers both a structure for visitors and several trips, just adjacent to the beaches of SapÃª and Maranduba.
						By doing this, you will have the opportunity to see stunning deserted beaches, hike through the Atlantic Forest, waterfalls, and ruins that offer intriguing details about Ubatuba's past.</p>

						<h2>Itamambuca beach</h2>
						<p>One of the several remote beaches in Ubatuba, Praia de Itamambuca is essentially always empty. This is because there is just one medium-to-difficult trail available for access.
							Following the creek that empties into the beach, the trail departs from Praia de Itamambuca in the left-hand corner of the beach. It is a track with a few narrow spots and, during wet seasons, steeper and slicker parts.
							Strong waves, numerous rock formations, and a significant Atlantic Forest presence on this beach help to preserve much of its natural and untamed appearance.</p>

						<h2>Sununga beach</h2>
						<p>This lovely beach, which has charming beach bars, draws visitors who appreciate the amazing view of the beach while tasting portions of seafood and a refreshing drink, as well as sunbathing on its sands.
						SkimBoarding, which uses round boards to move close to the surf, is also well known internationally as one of the top beach activities.
